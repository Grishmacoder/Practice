1.'''Create three variables in a single line and assign values to them in such a manner that each one of
them belongs to a different data type.'''

a,b,c = 1,2.01,'hello world'
print("a = ", a)
print("b = ", b)
print("c = ", c)

2.'''Create a variable of type complex and swap it with another variable of type integer.'''

a = 1+2j
b= 5
a,b = b,a
print(type(a))


3.'''3. Swap two numbers using a third variable and do the same task without using any third variable.'''

a,b = 1,5
print("before swap a and b are: ",a,b)
swap = a
a=b
b = swap
print("after swap a and b are: ",a,b)


x,y= 10, 20
print("before swap x and y are: ",x,y)
x,y = y,x
print("after swap x and y are: ",x,y)

4.'''Write a program that takes input from the user and prints it using both Python 2.x and Python 3.x
Version.'''

a= eval(input("enter the value of a:"))
b= eval(input("enter the value of b:"))

# for python 2.0
print a
print b

# for python 3.0
print(a)
print(b)

5.'''Write a program to complete the task given below:
Ask users to enter any 2 numbers in between 1-10 , add the two numbers and keep the sum in
another variable called z. Add 30 to z and store the output in variable result and print result as the
final output.'''

num1 = int(input("Enter a number between 1-10: "))
num2 = int(input("Enter another number between 1-10: "))
z = num1 + num2
result = z+30
print("Final Output is: ",result)

6.'''6. Write a program to check the data type of the entered values.
HINT: Printed output should say - The data type of the input value is : int/float/string/etc'''

x = eval(input("Enter anthing :"))
print("the data type of the entered value is {}:".format(type(x)))

7.'''7. Create Variables using formats such as Upper CamelCase, Lower CamelCase, SnakeCase and
UPPERCASE.'''

a = "GrishmaPatel"
b= "iPhone"
c = "first_name"
print(f"uppercamelcase: {a}\nlowercamelcase: {b}\nsnakecase: {c}")

8.'''If one data type value is assigned to ‘a’ variable and then a different data type value is assigned to ‘a’
again. Will it change the value? If Yes then Why?
yes

variables in Python can be reassigned to a new value that is a different data type from its current value. In fact,
variables can be reassigned to any valid value in Python, regardless of its current value.

Variables are essentially like an empty box, that can contain something like a string, number, or other value.
When you assign it a value, the box will contain that value, and when you reassign it, it will empty out the old value,
and the new value will be placed inside of it'''

a = 1
a = 'string'
print(a)
