'''Write a program in Python to allow the error of syntax to be handled using exception handling.
HINT: Use SyntaxError'''

# entered name is incorrect throw an exception and ask them to enter the name again. Make sure

'''3. Write a program to handle an error if the user entered a number more than four digits it should

5. Go through the link provided below to understand finally and raise concept:

Finally is used after the try and exception block which executes fix line of code for sure. Hence to free up the resources after our work is done, we use finaly keyword.
Raise keyword is used for raising the exception for perticular condition.


# 6. Read doc.txt file using Python File handling concept and return only the even length string from
# the file. Consider the content of doc.txt as given below:
# Hello I am a file
# Where you need to return the data string
# Which is of even length
# Make sure you return the content in The same link as it is present.

i = 1

f = open('doc.txt', 'r')
split_string = f.read().split(" ")
for i in split_string:
    if len(i) %2 == 0:
        print(i, end=" ")
