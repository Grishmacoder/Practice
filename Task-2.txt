'''1. Write a program in Python to perform the following operation:
If a number is divisible by 3 it should print “Consultadd” as a string
If a number is divisible by 5 it should print “Python Training” as a string
If a number is divisible by both 3 and 5 it should print “Consultadd - Python Training” as a
string.'''

2.'''Ask user to choose the following option first:
If User Enter 1 - Addition
If User Enter 2 - Subtraction
If User Enter 3 - Division
If User Enter 4 - Multiplication
If User Enter 5 - Average
Ask user to enter two numbers and keep those numbers in variables num1 and num2
respectively for the first 4 options mentioned above.
Ask the user to enter two more numbers as first and second for calculating the average as
soon as the user chooses an option 5.
At the end if the answer of any operation is Negative print a statement saying “NEGATIVE”
NOTE: At a time a user can only perform one action.'''
